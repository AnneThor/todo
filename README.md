# Task Manager

A simple Task Manager that allows the user to create tasks, delete tasks, and update the status of the tasks. Tasks are assigned to an individual at the time of creation.

New functionality added: ability to sort task by status, assignee, completeness, etc. Tasks are now paginated to display a max of 5 tasks at a time per page.
